# Hello-World
First repository on Github

I've just took up learning how to code during lockdown on the 1st June 2020. I thought I'd start with things I'm most likely to use so I've done a bit of HMTL website stuff, and I'm moving onto Java Script hopefully by the end of this week and then finally I'd like to learn some basics of Python too. Shoutout to my first follows SEWaters who can actually code unlike me whose just going to end up breaking things... but thats how you learn, right?
